  - **Joystick and Joystick S (Button):**  
    The analog inputs (X and Y) from the joystick modulate effect parameters (e.g., pitch modulation in non-piano mode), while the joystick button currently outputs a debug message.

## 2. Sound Generation

## 2.1 Waveform Modes
A synthesizer's sound generation relies on various waveform modes, each offering unique tonal characteristics suited for different musical applications. Implemented using a phase accumulator and various functions, these waveforms are generated algorithmically to produce consistent and predictable oscillations. 

- **Sawtooth:**  
  Uses a linear phase accumulator to generate a continuously increasing ramp that resets at its maximum value. The basic formula resembles:  
  `output = (phase / MAX_PHASE) * amplitude`  
  where `phase` is incremented by a constant step size per sample.

- **Triangle:**  
  Obtained by linearly increasing the signal to a peak and then decreasing it symmetrically. It leverages the absolute value function around the midpoint of the period:  
  `output = amplitude * (1 - 2 * abs((phase / MAX_PHASE) - 0.5))`

- **Sine:**  
  Generated typically using a lookup table or a hardware/software sine function. The phase accumulator provides an index into the sine table, ensuring smooth periodic oscillation:  
  `output = amplitude * sin(2Ï€ * (phase / MAX_PHASE))`

- **Square:**  
  Created by comparing the phase accumulator against a threshold (usually 50% duty cycle). If the phase is less than half of the period, the output is high; otherwise, it is low:  
  `output = (phase < MAX_PHASE/2) ? amplitude : -amplitude`

- **Pulse:**  
  Similar to the square wave but with a variable duty cycle. The duty cycle (adjustable via Knob 3 Rotation) determines the point at which the output transitions from high to low.  
  `output = (phase < dutyCycle * MAX_PHASE) ? amplitude : -amplitude`

- **Noise:**  
  Typically generated using a pseudo-random number generator to create a white noise signal. This mode does not rely on phase accumulation but instead produces a random amplitude value within the specified range.

- **Piano:**  
  Incorporates a sampled dynamic envelope and a pitch drop algorithm to simulate acoustic piano characteristics. Beyond generating the basic waveform:
  - **Envelope:** Each note is assigned an envelope that decays over time to simulate string damping.  
    *Logic:* The code calculates an envelope value which scales the amplitude, and once the envelope drops below a threshold, the note is removed.
  - **Pitch Drop:** A transient pitch modulation is applied at the onset of a note to mimic the natural drop in pitch as the string vibrates.

- **Rise:**  
  Implements a rising envelope combined with pitch modulation:
  - **Envelope:** Instead of decaying, a rising envelope function (such as an exponential approach to a ceiling) is applied so that the note starts soft and grows to its full amplitude.  
    *Formula example:* `env = 1 - exp(-k * elapsedTime)` where `k` controls the speed of rise.
  - **Pitch Factor:** A secondary modulation factor adjusts the pitch over time, defined by a custom function (`getRisePitchFactor`) to create evolving tonal characteristics. This mode does not remove notes quickly since the envelope is expected to reach its peak value and sustain the tone.
 
Additional techniques, such as envelope shaping, pitch modulation, and randomization, can allow more expressive and dynamic sounds, enabling the synthesizer to emulate acoustic instruments, create evolving textures, or generate percussive noise effects.

## 2.2 Polyphony Implementation

In our implementation (main.cpp), polyphony is achieved by maintaining a pool of active voices that can overlap, allowing multiple notes to be played simultaneously. Each active note is represented by a structure that tracks its step size (frequency), phase accumulator, and elapsed time. The system maintains a fixed-size array 'activeNotes[MAX_POLYPHONY]' to store these active voices, ensuring that no more than 'MAX_POLYPHONY' notes can sound at once.
```
struct ActiveNote {
    uint32_t stepSize;
    uint32_t phaseAcc;
    uint32_t elapsed;
};

#define MAX_POLYPHONY 12  // Maximum number of simultaneous notes

ActiveNote activeNotes[MAX_POLYPHONY];
uint8_t activeNoteCount = 0;
```

When a key is pressed, the system allocates a voice from the available pool and assigns it the corresponding note parameters, including waveform type, frequency, and envelope settings. If an available slot exists within the 'activeNotes' array, the new note is added, and its parameters are initialized. If all slots are occupied, a voice-stealing mechanism ensures continuous sound generation without interruption by replacing the oldest active voice with the new note, prioritizing recent inputs for a seamless user experience.

Conversely, when a key is released, the system scans the active voices for the corresponding note and removes it by shifting the remaining notes in the array. Additionally, voices naturally deactivate once their envelope decays below a certain threshold, preventing excessive resource consumption.

To maintain real-time performance, note events are processed using a message queue (msgInQ), where each message represents either a key press ('P') or release ('R'). The system listens for incoming events and updates the active voice list accordingly. 

By implementing this efficient voice management system, the synthesizer delivers smooth, uninterrupted sound even when multiple keys are pressed or released rapidly, replicating the behavior of professional polyphonic instruments.

```
if (xQueueReceive(msgInQ, localMsg, portMAX_DELAY) == pdPASS) {
            TASK_START();
            if (localMsg[0] == 'R') {  // Release message: remove the note.
                uint8_t note = localMsg[2];
                for (uint8_t i = 0; i < activeNoteCount; i++) {
                    if (activeNotes[i].stepSize == stepSizes[note]) {
                        // Remove the note by shifting the remaining notes
                        for (uint8_t j = i; j < activeNoteCount - 1; j++) {
                            activeNotes[j] = activeNotes[j + 1];
                        }
                        activeNoteCount--;
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
            else if (localMsg[0] == 'P') {  // Press message: add the note.
                uint8_t octave = localMsg[1];
                uint8_t note = localMsg[2];
                if (note < 12) {
                    uint32_t step = stepSizes[note];
                    // If there's room, add a new note.
                    if (activeNoteCount < MAX_POLYPHONY) {
                        activeNotes[activeNoteCount].stepSize = step;
                        activeNotes[activeNoteCount].phaseAcc = 0;
                        activeNotes[activeNoteCount].elapsed = 0; // reset elapsed time
                        activeNoteCount++;
                    }
                    else {
                        // Voice stealing: find the oldest note and replace it.
                        uint8_t idxToSteal = 0;
                        uint32_t maxElapsed = activeNotes[0].elapsed;
                        for (uint8_t i = 1; i < activeNoteCount; i++) {
                            if (activeNotes[i].elapsed > maxElapsed) {
                                maxElapsed = activeNotes[i].elapsed;
                                idxToSteal = i;
                            }
                        }
                        activeNotes[idxToSteal].stepSize = step;
                        activeNotes[idxToSteal].phaseAcc = 0;
                        activeNotes[idxToSteal].elapsed = 0;
                    }
                }
            }
```

## 2.3 Transposition and Octave Control

Transposition and octave control in the synthesizer provide flexible pitch manipulation, allowing users to shift the pitch of notes dynamically. They are handled in main.cpp by combining adjustments from both the joystick and Knob 0 for fine and coarse transposition shifts, along with octave selection via Knob 2.

### Transposition (Knob 0 & Joystick)
The base frequency of a note ($f_{base}$) is adjusted based on a transposition value, T, which is the sum of the coarse adjustment from Knob 0 and a fine, fractional adjustment derived from the joystick input. The transposed frequency is calculated using the formula:
   
$f_{transposed} = f_{base}$ * 2^(T/12)

Where:
- T = knob0_value + (joystick_offset * fineTuneFactor)
- knob0_value maps to integer semitone shifts.
- joystick_offset provides a fractional enhancement for smoother pitch modulation.
- fineTuneFactor scales the joystick's contribution to semitone shifts.

This dual adjustment system enables precise pitch modifications, from subtle vibrato effects to full key changes.

### Octave Control (Knob 2)
Once the transposition is applied, Knob 2 further modifies the pitch by shifting the frequency up or down in octaves. This is achieved by scaling the transposed frequency by a power-of-two factor:

$f_{octave} = f_{transposed}$ * 2^(N - $N_{ref})$

Where:
- N is the octave selected via Knob 2.
- $N_{ref}$ is the reference or middle octave.

### Final Frequency Calculation
Combining both adjustments, the final frequency for a note is computed as:

$f_{final} = f_{base}$ * 2^((knob0_value + (joystick_offset * fineTuneFactor)) / 12) * 2^(N - $N_{ref})$

This formula allows for seamless integration of transposition and octave adjustments, ensuring that pitch modifications remain musically accurate and responsive to user input.

However, when the formula was initially implemented, the timing constraints were not met properly as the computation time to calculate exponents is signifcantly high. To solve this issue, the transposed frequencies were replaced with pre-computed values that can scale the frequency, also using the same formula above. These scaling values are stored in a lookup table, and depending on the amount of transposing required, the current frequency will be multiplied with the corresponding constant in the table. This would remove the extra computational time for exponential calculation, and after testing, satisfy the timing requirements of the system. 

## 3. Key Matrix Scanning

- **8x4 Key Matrix:**  
  A dedicated key matrix is scanned to detect key presses (notes). This enables real-time generation and removal of notes based on key activity.

- **Note Mapping:**  
  Each key (0â€“11) maps to a specific frequency by selecting a corresponding step size within the waveform generation algorithm.

## 4. East and West Keyboard Detection

- **Combining multiple synthesizers:**
  Using the East and West Detection local input, the synthesizer can detected if a separate synthesizer is attached on its left or right.
  ```
  else if (localInputs[23]){
            Serial.println("West Detect Initiated");
        }
        else if (localInputs[27]){
            Serial.println("East Detect Initiated");
        }
  ```

## Future Enhancements
As the synthesizer project evolves, several future enhancements can be implemented to increase flexibility, improve usability, and expand creative possibilities. Below are some key areas for improvement and their potential impact on the system.

- **Enhanced Debugging Functions:**
  While the current system already provides debug messages for various controls (such as Knob 2S, Knob 3S, and the Joystick), future revisions could introduce real-time logging, graphical debugging interfaces, and diagnostic modes to further streamline development and troubleshooting. Possible enhancements include a serial console or UI-based tool that displays real-time values for frequency, amplitude, and envelope state, making it easier to identify potential issues.
- **Extended Effects and Modulations:**  
  Currently, the joystick is used for fine-tuning pitch, but future versions could expand its functionality to introduce advanced modulation effects that enhance expressiveness. For instance, the joystick could control depth and rate of vibrato (pitch modulation) or tremolo (amplitude modulation), creating richer and more organic sounds. Furthermore, assigning joystick movement to a low-pass filter cutoff frequency would allow real-time tone shaping, similar to analog synthesizers.
- **Adding dependent octaves with combined synthesizers:**  
  The idea is to create an adaptive octave assignment algorithm that automatically organizes pitch relationships between multiple connected synthesizers. Specifically, when a new synthesizer is connected, its default octave is adjusted based on its relative position in the setup. For example, the leftmost synthesizer plays in a lower octave, and each synthesizer to the right shifts one octave higher.

  To implement this, each synthesizer could register itself by atomically incrementing a global counter, determining its relative position and assigned octave. A mutex-protected list can be added to track active synthesizers, ensuring that when one disconnects, the remaining ones adjust accordingly. Additionally, a queue will be needed to allow communication between syntehsizers and dynamically updating their octave settings in real time. However, it will require extensive testing and debugging to achieve this function. 

## Conclusion
Overall, this detailed breakdown not only highlights the core hardware interactions but also explains the signal processing and modulation techniques that contribute to the ES-Synth Keyboard.
